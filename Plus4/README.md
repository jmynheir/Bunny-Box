# INSTALLATION

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Unload all filament from the box before you start.** Once Happy Hare is installed you cannot load or unload filament until [calibration](#-calibration--required-before-first-use) is done, and gear calibration has to be performed with the filament cut flush at the gate — not fully loaded. Unload every gate now, while the stock Qidi firmware is still in control.

## AUTO INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install Happy Hare on your Qidi Plus4 is to use the provided automated script. 

1. **Connect to your printer** via SSH.
2. **Download and run the script**:
   ```bash
   wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wazzup77/Bunny-Box/refs/heads/main/Plus4/install-bb-p4.sh | bash
   ```
   
The script will backup your configurations, download the necessary files, prompt you for your serial ID, and automatically install Happy Hare.
Don't forget to update the machine gcodes in the slicer to use the ones provided in the [slicer_machine_gcodes_hh.md](./config_hh-standalone/slicer_machine_gcodes_hh.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> **The installer does NOT calibrate your MMU.** After installation you MUST calibrate before your first print — see [CALIBRATION — REQUIRED BEFORE FIRST USE](#-calibration--required-before-first-use) at the bottom of this guide. This is the most commonly missed step.

## REVERTING TO STOCK

The installer script doubles as the uninstaller. Re-run it on a printer where bunnybox / Happy Hare is already installed and it will offer a revert option:

```bash
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wazzup77/Bunny-Box/refs/heads/main/Plus4/install-bb-p4.sh | bash
```

When the menu appears, choose **2) Revert to stock**. The script will:
- restore `printer.cfg` and `gcode_macro.cfg` from the oldest `backup_hh_*` directory (your pre-install snapshot),
- move the current `bunnybox_macros.cfg` and `mmu/` folder into a new `backup_revert_<timestamp>/` so the revert itself can be undone,
- clear `mmu__revision` from `saved_variables.cfg`, and
- restart Klipper and Moonraker with `sudo systemctl restart klipper` or a power cycle.

### Non-interactive revert (for scripts)

If you want to call the revert from another script, pass `--revert` to skip the menu entirely:

```bash
# Standalone (one-liner)
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wazzup77/Bunny-Box/refs/heads/main/Plus4/install-bb-p4.sh | bash -s -- --revert

# Or from a cloned repo
./install-bb-p4.sh --revert
```

Use `--help` to see all flags. The revert leaves the cloned `~/Happy-Hare/` repo and the custom `aht10.py` module on disk; they are harmless once `printer.cfg` no longer references them.

## MANUAL INSTALLATION

### HAPPY HARE INSTALLATION
<details>
<summary> STEP 1: HAPPY HARE INSTALL </summary>

1. Select your config variant. At present, you can select from:

- [`config_hh-standalone`](./config_hh-standalone/README.md) - Happy Hare focused config, taking advantage of its features for a more Happy-Hare experience

2. Copy the configs (`mmu` folder and `bunnybox_macros.cfg`) from the selected variant to your printer's config folder.

3. Add your printer's serial address to `mmu/base/mmu.cfg`. To do this, connect to your printer via SSH and run:

```bash
ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
```

This will give you a list of USB devices. It should say something like:

```bash
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_QIDI_BOX_V1_1.1.1_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Copy that into your mmu.cfg in the `serial:` parameter, replacing the old value.

4. Install Happy Hare from the [Qidi Box fork](https://github.com/Wazzup77/Happy-Hare). To do this, connect to your printer via SSH and run:

```bash
cd ~
git clone -b bunnybox https://github.com/Wazzup77/Happy-Hare.git
```

5. Run the install script `Happy-Hare/install.sh` and pray that it does not break stuff.

```bash
./Happy-Hare/install.sh
```

6. Add `mmu__revision = 0` to `saved_variables.cfg'

```bash
echo "mmu__revision = 0" >> printer_data/config/saved_variables.cfg
```

7. Restart Klipper

```bash
sudo service klipper restart
```
</details>

### STEP 2:printer.cfg CHANGES

<details>
<summary> `[printer.cfg]` CHANGES </summary>

0. Backup your printer.cfg file! Just in case you want to return to the stock config.

1. Remove Qidi's stock box config `[include box.cfg]`.

2. Add `[include bunnybox_macros.cfg]` at the top.

3. **Recommended:** Comment out or delete the entire `[hall_filament_width_sensor]` section. It reads `adc1: PA2` and `adc2: PA3` — the same pins the MMU uses for `extruder_switch_pin`/`extruder_switch_pin2`. Two ADC readers on the same pins can cause `Timer too close` MCU crashes. The MMU already provides filament detection, so the stock hall sensor is redundant.

   > **The installer does this for you** (it comments the section out and copies `adc1`/`adc2` into `extruder_switch_pin`/`extruder_switch_pin2`), so you only need this step if installing by hand.
   >
   > **FreeDi / Kalico users, read this:** on those firmwares the toolhead is a *separate MCU*, so the stock sensor reads `Toolhead:PA2` / `Toolhead:PA3`, not a bare `PA2`/`PA3`. A bare pin name binds to the **main** MCU — an unconnected pin that floats and triggers a false "filament runout at extruder" the moment a print starts. Set `extruder_switch_pin`/`extruder_switch_pin2` in `mmu_hardware.cfg` to **exactly** whatever your stock `[hall_filament_width_sensor]`'s `adc1`/`adc2` were (e.g. `Toolhead:PA2` / `Toolhead:PA3`). Note the MCU is named differently per firmware — copy the name from your own printer.cfg.

   If you prefer to keep the section (not recommended), modify it as follows (removing or commenting out the red lines, and setting `pause_on_runout` to `False`):
```diff
[hall_filament_width_sensor]
adc1: PA2
adc2: PA3
cal_dia1: 1.50
cal_dia2: 2.0
raw_dia1: 14197
raw_dia2: 15058
default_nominal_filament_diameter: 1.75
max_difference: 0
measurement_delay: 50
enable: false
measurement_interval: 10
logging: False
-min_diameter: 0.3
-use_current_dia_while_delay: False
+pause_on_runout: False
-runout_gcode:
-            RESET_FILAMENT_WIDTH_SENSOR
-            M118 Filament run out
-            {% set can_auto_reload = printer.save_variables.variables.auto_reload_detect|default(0) %}
-            {% if can_auto_reload == 1 %}
-              AUTO_RELOAD_FILAMENT
-            {% endif %}
-event_delay: 3.0
-pause_delay: 0.5
```

3b. **Also disable the stock filament-tangle switch.** Separately from the hall sensor, the Plus4 has a `[filament_switch_sensor fila]` section (a microswitch on `switch_pin: U_1:PC3`). It ships with `pause_on_runout: True`, so it can pause the print on its own when it trips — independently of the MMU — and Happy Hare warns about it at every boot (`Warning: filament_switch_sensor 'fila' found in printer configuration...`). Happy Hare handles runout via its own sensors, so set `pause_on_runout` to `False` (do not just comment the line — Klipper defaults it back to `True`) and comment out the `runout_gcode`:
```diff
[filament_switch_sensor fila]
-pause_on_runout: True
+pause_on_runout: False
-runout_gcode:
-    M118 Filament tangle detected
-event_delay: 3.0
-pause_delay: 0.5
switch_pin: U_1:PC3
```
   The auto-installer now does this for you; this step is only needed for manual installs, or for existing installs set up before this was added.

4. Make sure Happy Hare files were included during install in printer.cfg: 
```
[include mmu/base/*.cfg]
[include mmu/optional/client_macros.cfg]
```
Other mmu directories should not be included!

5. **Recommended:** Wrap the `[idle_timeout]` gcode so it does not kill the box heaters during a Happy Hare drying cycle (`MMU_HEATER DRY=1`). Without this, an `idle_timeout` shorter than your drying cycle will turn off the heaters mid-dry. Stock Qidi ships with `timeout: 43200` (12 hours), so this only matters if you've shortened the timeout or want to dry for longer than 12 hours.

```diff
[idle_timeout]
timeout: 43200
gcode:
-    PRINT_END
+    {% if printer.mmu is defined and printer.mmu.drying_state[0] == 'active' %}
+      SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=0
+      SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=0
+      SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=chamber TARGET=0
+    {% else %}
+      PRINT_END
+    {% endif %}
```

   If your `[idle_timeout]` section only has `timeout:` and no `gcode:` block, you are relying on Klipper's implicit default of `TURN_OFF_HEATERS` + `M84`. Add the wrapped block to the section, with `TURN_OFF_HEATERS` and `M84` as the `{% else %}` branch.

</details>

### STEP 3: gcode_macro.cfg CHANGES

<details>
<summary> `[gcode_macro.cfg]` CHANGES </summary>

0. Backup your gcode_macro.cfg file! Just in case you want to return to the stock config.

1. In PRINT_START we need to change Box detection logic:
```diff
[gcode_macro PRINT_START]
gcode:
[...]
-    {% if printer.save_variables.variables.box_count >= 1 %} 
+    {% if printer.mmu.num_gates >= 4 %} 
        SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=load_retry_num VALUE=0 # saved variables probably need a rework
        SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=retry_step VALUE=None
        SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=is_tool_change VALUE=0
        {% for i in range(16) %}
            SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=runout_{i} VALUE=0
            G4 P100
        {% endfor %}
        SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=extrude_state VALUE=-1
-        {% if printer.save_variables.variables.enable_box == 1 %}
+        {% if printer.mmu.enabled %}
            BOX_PRINT_START EXTRUDER={extruder} HOTENDTEMP={hotendtemp}
            M400
            EXTRUSION_AND_FLUSH HOTEND={hotendtemp}
        {% endif %}
[...]
```

2. Remove `PAUSE` (or comment it out).

3. Remove `RESUME_PRINT` (or comment it out).

4. Remove `RESUME` (or comment it out).

5. Remove `CANCEL_PRINT` (or comment it out).

6. Remove `DETECT_INTERRUPTION` (or comment it out). `bunnybox_macros.cfg` provides a no-op replacement; commenting the stock macro out (rather than relying on `rename_existing:`) keeps the install working on mainline Klipper / FreeDi where the stock macro may already be absent.

7. Comment out the `save_last_file` call at the end of `PRINT_START`. This is Qidi's power-loss recovery hook and sets `was_interrupted=True` in `saved_variables.cfg` on every print start; PLR is disabled under Happy Hare (see [DETECT_INTERRUPTION override](./config_hh-standalone/bunnybox_macros.cfg)) so the call is wasteful.
```diff
     SET_PRINT_STATS_INFO CURRENT_LAYER=1
     ENABLE_ALL_SENSOR
-    save_last_file
+#    save_last_file
```

</details>


### STEP 4: USER INTERFACE

<details>
<summary> USER INTERFACE </summary>

If you want to have a section in your printer web interface, install baseline fluidd or mainsail, which both have HH implemented. You can do that via kiauh, which comes preinstalled on Qidi printers.

1. Update kiauh

```bash
    cd kiauh
    git pull
```

2. Run kiauh to reinstall fluidd or mainsail

```bash
    ./kiauh.sh
```

You want to REMOVE the existing Fluidd installation and install it again - this will move you from the Qidi version to mainline, which supports Happy Hare.
Alternatively you can also install Mainsail instead of Fluidd.

</details>


### STEP 5: SLICER SETTINGS

<details>
<summary> SLICER SETTINGS </summary>

Go into your pritner settings in the slicer and change them to use the [following machine g-codes](./config_hh-standalone/slicer_machine_gcodes_hh.md).

</details>

### (optional) STEP 6: ENVIRONMENT SENSOR

<details>
<summary> ENVIRONMENT SENSOR </summary>

> If you are on mainline Klipper, Freedi or Kalico, you can skip this step altogether, though it won't hurt anything if you do it. I recommend doing this step for stability, but you can skip it by changing the `[temperature_sensor box1_env]` `sensor_type` to `AHT10` in the `mmu_hardware.cfg`. 

To be able to view temperature and humidity in the printer web interface reliably, you need to install a aht10.py module from modern Klipper. 

1. Go to the Klipper directory and clone the module

```bash
    cd klipper/klippy/extras

    sudo mv aht10.py aht10.py.bak

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wazzup77/Bunny-Box/refs/heads/main/aht10.py
```

</details>


# ⚠️ CALIBRATION — REQUIRED BEFORE FIRST USE

> [!CAUTION]
> **Happy Hare will NOT load filament or print reliably until it is calibrated.** Whether you used the auto installer or installed manually, calibration is a separate, mandatory step done once after installation, before your first print. It is the single most commonly missed step.

On the Plus4:

- **Gear calibration** (`MMU_CALIBRATE_GEAR`) — ⚠️ **REQUIRED**
- **Encoder calibration** (`MMU_CALIBRATE_ENCODER`) — ⚠️ **REQUIRED**
- Bowden length (`MMU_CALIBRATE_BOWDEN`) and per-gate (`MMU_CALIBRATE_GATES`) — *optional*

Follow the official [Happy Hare — Type B Calibration wiki](https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki/MMU-Calibration-TypeB) for the exact procedure and commands.

# ADDITIONAL TUNING

1. Speed! The default Qidi profile is very slow. You can speed it up by increasing the values in the SPEEDS section in mmu_parameters.cfg. Keep in mind that these settings will vary between different Qidi Boxes. Generally loading speeds can be increased by 20-30% without issues, but keep in mind that going fast may cause filament swaps to fail. Going too fast may also cause the filament to be ground up by the gears. Remember to recalibrate the encoder after changing speeds (its measurement will vary widely depending on speed).
2. Tip forming. The base configuration uses the cutter. Tip forming allows you to reduce filament waste by removing the whole filament piece from the hotend. The disadvantage is that good tuning is needed to avoid clogs. Although the profile in these configs has been tested on multiple filaments across multiple Plus4 printers, it may require tuning on your specific printer/filament. If you have a custom hotend, you need to update the configration too. Activate it by changing:

`form_tip_macro: _MMU_CUT_TIP` to `form_tip_macro: _MMU_FORM_TIP`

To additionally improve the movement logic on tip forming (by moving to the purge chute first) add `toolchange` to the list of paramters at `variable_enable_park_printing` as such:

`variable_enable_park_printing   : 'toolchange,runout,load,complete,pause,cancel'	; Empty '' to disable parking`

If you ever want to switch back to cutting, remove the `toolchange` and revert to `form_tip_macro: _MMU_CUT_TIP`.
